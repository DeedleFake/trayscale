gtkbuildergen
=============

gtkbuildergen generates Go code from GtkBuilder UI definition XML files. It is geared primarily towards use in Trayscale, but adding new features that might become necessary shouldn't be too difficult in general. If you'd like a feature added because you're using it in another project, feel free to file an issue and ask for it and I'll get to it when I can, or you can send a pull request to add the feature yourself.
